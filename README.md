    A website that helps student gather more information about the various degrees at Wayne State University. This is a continuation of our original project <a href="https://github.com/WSU-4110/Degree-Door">Degree Door</a> from our Software Engineering course, and all the links will take you to our documentation on our repo which is hosted on the university's organization.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project is a fullstack web application that will allow users to find information regarding the degrees and their relative courses at Wayne State University. Users will be able to register an account to access the main functionalities of the website. From there, users can see forums with reviews posted by current students, past students, alumni, or professors that have some insight on a degree.<br><br>
The project was originally developed for a required software engineering course at Wayne State University. We have decided to rework the project to implement more typesafety and better handling of authentication, as well as to challenge our skills as software engineers.<br><br>
For the technology stack, the project utilizes the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), and the project was bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
